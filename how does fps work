What is FPS?
Frames per second (FPS) is the metric used to quantify frame rate. FPS measures the number of images that are displayed per second on a stream. With FPS,
the rule of thumb is the more frames per second, the smoother and more realistic the video.

When network conditions are perfect, a higher FPS will yield a smoother video appearance on the viewerâ€™s screen.

To put this metric into perspective, the average person can perceive about 16 to 20 FPS as a continuous, smooth motion.

Why Does Frame Rate Matter?

When you're streaming a video, your viewers expect smooth, fluid footage. If your footage is choppy or lagging,
viewers will quickly lose interest and tune out. Luckily, the frame rate gives brands and creators more control over how their stream turns out.
